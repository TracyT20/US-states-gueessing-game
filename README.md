# US-states-guessing-game

Are you looking for a fun way to learn the 50 US States? Look no further! The Us-states guessing game is what you need.

Guess a US state and find out where it is located on the US map.

If the user types "Exit" instead of a state, the game closes and a csv file called "states_to_learn" containing the names of all the states that have not been guessed is created

if the user clicks ' cancel' Or 'X', the game is stopped and no csv file is generated
